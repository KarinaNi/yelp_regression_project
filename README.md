# Yelp Regression Project

This project demonstrates the analysis and regression modeling performed on the Yelp dataset. The goal is to predict the star rating of a business based on various features.

## Dataset

The Yelp dataset used in this project can be downloaded from [https://www.yelp.com/dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset). It contains information about businesses, reviews, and user data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Anaconda Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/products/navigator)
- Jupyter Notebook (included with Anaconda)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project:

1. Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/your-username/yelp-regression-project.git ```

2. Download the Yelp dataset from [https://www.yelp.com/dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) and extract the files.

3. Place the relevant JSON files from the dataset into the project directory.

4. Launch Anaconda Navigator and open Jupyter Notebook.

5. Navigate to the project directory in Jupyter Notebook and open the `yelp_rent_regression.ipynb` file.

6. Run the notebook by clicking on "Run" in the toolbar and selecting "Run All Cells". This will execute all the cells in the notebook and perform the analysis.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `yelp_rent_regression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and regression modeling.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for running it.

## Results

The notebook `yelp_rent_regression.ipynb` contains the detailed analysis and results of the regression modeling. It includes data visualization, model evaluation, and insights derived from the Yelp dataset.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

These dependencies are typically included with Anaconda and should be available in the Jupyter Notebook environment.
